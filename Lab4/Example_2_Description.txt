Example 2 description

This video shows the code working, succesfully sending clock messages from PD
to Python. The process used was running the pure data patch, initiating the 
python script. Both the patch and the python script were left unchanged from
the provided examples, but one minor change was the port number. When ending
the script with a keyboard interrupt (ctrl-z on windows) the port remained
in use, so I incremented the port values instead of ending the threading
process for the original port.
