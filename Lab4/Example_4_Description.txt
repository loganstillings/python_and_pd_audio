Example 4 description

This video shows the code working, succesfully performing two way communication
between PD and python. The process used was running the pure data patch, and initiating
the python script. A few parameters were changed in order to receive the output. 
Namely, I changed the parameter for the onset difference range to be between 100 and 1000 ms.
The notes selected for quantization this time were notes of the C dorian mode.
