Example 1 description

This video shows the code working, succesfully sending notes from python
to PD. The process used was running the pure data patch, initiating the 
python script, and using a MIDI channel (using a piano instrument) listening for
MIDI input from PD. The python code was unchanged from the original example
and only notes on the C major scale were selected in the PD quantizer.
