Example 3 description

This video shows the code working, succesfully performing two way communication
between PD and python. The process used was running the pure data patch, and initiating
the python script. Both the patch and the python script were left unchanged from
the provided examples. The only 4 notes were selected for the quantization of the midi
notes.
